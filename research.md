<!-- ## Current research -->
I am using computational approaches to study the structure and function of locomotor circuits in the *Drosophila* ventral nerve cord (VNC, a spinal cord analog). I use synapse-level connectome datasets as a basis for modeling neural activity in the VNC, and have started to work with a biomechanical model to simulate the flyâ€™s kinematics. I hope that the connectome can provide big-picture insights into the organization of the motor system and generate some predictions I can test in real flies. I am co-advised by [John Tuthill](https://faculty.washington.edu/tuthill/index.html) and [Bing Brunton](https://www.bingbrunton.com/).
